Xen


Xen is a hypervisor using a microkernel design, providing services that allow
multiple computer operating systems to execute on the same computer hardware
concurrently.

The University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory developed the first versions
of Xen.  The Xen community develops and maintains Xen as free and open-source
software, subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL),
version 2.  Xen is currently available for the IA-32, x86-64 and ARM
instruction sets.
